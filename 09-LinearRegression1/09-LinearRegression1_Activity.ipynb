    "Amphetamine is a drug that suppresses appetite. In a study of this effect, a pharmocologist randomly allocated 24 rats to three treatment groups to receive an injection of amphetamine at one of two dosage levels (2.5 mg/kg or 5.0 mg/kg), or an injection of saline solution (0 mg/kg). She measured the amount of food consumed by each animal (in gm/kg) in the 3-hour period following injection. The results (gm of food consumed per kg of body weight) are shown below.\n"
